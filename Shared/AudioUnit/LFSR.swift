//    The linear feedback shift register (LFSR) generates a pseudo-random bit sequence.
//    It has a 15-bit shift register with feedback. When clocked by the frequency timer,
//    the low two bits (0 and 1) are XORed, all bits are shifted right by one, and the
//    result of the XOR is put into the now-empty high bit. If width mode is 1 (NR43),
//    the XOR result is ALSO put into bit 6 AFTER the shift, resulting in a 7-bit LFSR.
//    The waveform output is bit 0 of the LFSR, INVERTED.
