# Game Boy Synthesizer Plugin

**Work in progress**

This is an AU3 wrapper around the Game Boy sound unit. This exposes the Game Boy APU as a MIDI-controllable sythesizer instrument, usable as a standalone app or as a plugin for GarageBand or Logic. It is powered by [Gb_Snd_Emu](http://blargg.8bitalley.com/libs/audio.html#Gb_Snd_Emu), the audio implementation used by many emulators including [Visual Boy Advance - M](https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m).

As an instrument, the Game Boy APU is a pretty constrained synthesizer. It contains 2 square wave oscillators, a 32-sample 4-bit arbitary wavetable oscillator, and a noise oscillator with a variable frequency. All oscillators except the wave have a linear volume envelope. One of the square waves has a linear frequency envelope. The resolution in both time and amplitude is relatively low, so the pitches are slightly out of tune. There's no controllable filter, only a static passive high-pass filter. The limited CPU of the platform limits the resolution at which these parameters are controllable. All of this adds up to a limited but iconic sound.
